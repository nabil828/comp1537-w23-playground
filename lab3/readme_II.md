# Lab 3 - Part II - Stars!‚≠ê
Write JavaScript code that uses nested loops to draw a triangle of stars.


## Demo
https://subtle-beignet-6e9d35.netlify.app/q2/

The code should draw a right angled triangle of stars with `n` rows.

The number of rows should be passed as the argument to the function, so you can change the number of rows to make a bigger or smaller triangle. 

```js
drawTriangle(5);
```

```

# Pseudo-Code  

```js
function drawTriangle(n) {
  // first, loop through the number of rows
    // initialize an empty string to hold the row's contents
    // loop through the number of columns
      // add a star to the row
    // print the row
}
drawTriangle(5);

```

## Hints
-  Use two nested loops.
   -   The outer loop, controlled by the variable `i`, runs `n` times, where `n` is the number of rows passed as an argument to the function `drawTriangle()`.
   - The inner loop, controlled by the variable `j`, runs `i` times, where `i` is the current value of the outer loop variable.
     - On each iteration of the inner loop, a star is added to a `row` variable, and at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, the `row` variable is logged to the console.
